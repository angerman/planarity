# planar-quad

This is work in progress. On planar local deformations and subdivision approaches.

## Usage

Currently there are three scripts that can be executed.

`$ lein run -m scripts.demo-doo-sabin`

will perform a Doo-Sabin subdivision on a few objects.

`$ lein run -m scripts.demo-catmull-clark`

will perform a Catmull-Clark subdivision on a few objects.

`$ lein run -m scripts.demo-planar-subd`

will perform/attempt a planar subdivision on a few objects.

## Installation

It is strongly suggested that [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) is used.

`$ lein deps`

`$ lein native-deps`

should be sufficient to install all required dependencies. (JReality,...)
